/**
 * The Sundays apps. One codebase builds each of them (desktop/dist.mjs).
 *
 * Since 1.33 there are three: Sundays (everything that runs on the Mac, including FOH Companion
 * mode), Sundays Operations and Sundays AVL. Services, Workflows, Paging and FOH are retired (in the
 * `retired` version): every release still has a farewell build of each that only says they're now
 * part of Sundays and opens it.
 *
 * - engine apps (Sundays, Services, Workflows, Paging) run the Sundays server on this Mac. They
 *   share one data folder and one running server: whichever opens first hosts it, the others use
 *   it, so sign-in, settings, the weekend and Micboard are the same in all of them.
 * - FOH is an FOH companion (its own data, linked to the main computer).
 * - Operations and AVL are Sundays' cloud apps (the website's screens in a Mac window).
 *
 * Each window says which app it belongs to in its user agent ("SundaysApp/<id>"), so the screens
 * and the server know which app is asking.
